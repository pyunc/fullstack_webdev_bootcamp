## General info
This is another tiny project aims to consolidate my web development coding skills. I understand that a DS work must have a great comprehesion of the visualization tools for several reasons. Aside traditional tools such as Tableau, Plotly and Seaborn and more modern approachs ones such as Streamlit, a basic understend of web development is required, specialy when there is no previous background in this area of study such as my case. 

I joined a Full Stack Web Development BootCamp and several side projects were assigned as a practice exercise and initial mini portfolio creation. The course were composed by 3 main steps: 

* Frontend development
* Backend development
* CI/DI practice and Deployment

The **first project**  is a personal page using only HTML with some personal information. Althought very simple, famous professors from the computer /  engineering department have same structure home page. Kind funny by the way. There is a portuguese expression : 'Em casa de ferreiro, o colher Ã© de pau'.
